# Linear-Regression-for-Home-Prices
Predict Home Prices with Python and Linear Regression <br>
Create a linear regression model to predict house prices based on house sizes. Using a scatterplot of test data, the model will form a relationship between the two variables and then makes predictions.

# Linear Regression
In statistics, linear regression is used to model relationships between independent x variables (e.g., house sizes) and a dependent y variable (e.g., house prices) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
